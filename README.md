### [**Description**](#) <a name="descr"></a>
Semantic segmentation on satellite images of forests can identify and delineate the specific areas covered by trees, providing a detailed understanding of the distribution and extent of forested regions. This information is crucial not only for applications such as monitoring deforestation and assessing forest health, but also for detecting and mapping forest fires, enabling timely response and mitigation efforts.
